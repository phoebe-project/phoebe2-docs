# Tutorials

Each of the following tutorials builds upon previous tutorials, so it will be most efficient to work through them sequentially at first. However, each should run independently, so feel free to jump in at any point to review a specific concept.

For more specific use-cases, see the example scripts below.

1. [General Concepts](tutorials/general_concepts.ipynb)
2. [Building a System](tutorials/building_a_system.ipynb)
3. [Saving and Loading](tutorials/saving_and_loading.ipynb)
4. [Constraints](tutorials/constraints.ipynb)
5. [Datasets](tutorials/datasets.ipynb)
6. [Computing Observables](tutorials/compute.ipynb)
7. [Plotting](tutorials/plotting.ipynb)
8. [Accessing and Plotting Meshes](tutorials/meshes.ipynb)

## Migrating from PHOEBE 2.0 to PHOEBE 2.1

These tutorials highlight the major changes between versions 2.0.x and 2.1+ in the following topics:

* [Potential/Rpole to Requiv](tutorials/20_21_requiv.ipynb)
* [Semidetached Constraints](tutorials/20_21_semidetached.ipynb)
* [Plotting](tutorials/20_21_plotting.ipynb)
* [Meshes](tutorials/20_21_meshes.ipynb)
* [nparray](tutorials/20_21_nparray.ipynb)

## Advanced tutorials

The following set of advanced tutorials follow the same format as the tutorials above, but cover individual advanced topics and do not depend on each other.

These all assume comfort with the tutorials listed above, but should not need to be read in any particular order.

* [Advanced: Settings](tutorials/settings.ipynb)
* [Advanced: Animations](tutorials/animations.ipynb)
* [Advanced: Alternate Backends](tutorials/alternate_backends.ipynb)
* [Advanced: Detaching from Run Compute](tutorials/detach.ipynb)
* [Advanced: Adding Custom Passband Tables](tutorials/passbands.ipynb)
