# Binary with Spots
# ============================
# 
# Setup
# -----------------------------

# As always, let's do imports and initialize a logger and a new bundle.  See [Building a System](../tutorials/building_a_system.html) for more details.

# In[1]:


get_ipython().magic(u'matplotlib inline')


# In[2]:


import phoebe
from phoebe import u # units
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

logger = phoebe.logger()

b = phoebe.default_binary()


# Adding Spots
# ---------------------

# Let's add one spot to each of our stars in the binary.
# 
# **NOTE**: the parameter name was changed from "colon" to "long" in 2.0.2.  For all further releases in 2.0.X, the "colon" parameter still exists but is read-only.  Starting with 2.1.0, the "colon" parameter will no longer exist.
# 
# A spot is a feature, and needs to be attached directly to a component upon creation.  Providing a tag for 'feature' is entirely optional - if one is not provided it will be created automatically.

# In[3]:


b.add_feature('spot', component='primary', feature='spot01')


# As a shortcut, we can also call add_spot directly.

# In[4]:


b.add_spot(component='secondary', feature='spot02')


# Spot Parameters
# -----------------

# A spot is defined by the colatitude and longitude of its center, its angular radius, and the ratio of temperature of the spot to the local intrinsic value.
# 
# **NOTE**: the parameter name was changed from "colon" to "long" in 2.0.2.  For all further releases in 2.0.X, the "colon" parameter still exists but is read-only.  Starting with 2.1.0, the "colon" parameter will no longer exist.

# In[5]:


print b['spot01']


# In[6]:


b.set_value(qualifier='relteff', feature='spot01', value=0.9)


# In[7]:


b.set_value(qualifier='radius', feature='spot01', value=30)


# In[8]:


b.set_value(qualifier='colat', feature='spot01', value=45)


# In[9]:


b.set_value(qualifier='long', feature='spot01', value=90)


# To see the spot, let's compute and plot the protomesh.

# In[10]:


b.run_compute(protomesh=True)


# In[11]:


axs, artists = b.plot(component='primary', facecolor='teffs', facecmap='YlOrRd', edgecolor=None)


# Spot Corotation
# --------------------
# 
# **NOTE:** spots failed to corotate correctly before version 2.0.2.
# 
# The positions (colat, long) of a spot are defined at t0 (note: t0@system, not necessarily t0_perpass or t0_supconj).  If the stars are not synchronous, then the spots will corotate with the star.  To illustrate this, let's set the syncpar > 1 and plot the mesh at three different phases from above.

# In[12]:


b.set_value('syncpar@primary', 1.5)


# In[13]:


b.add_dataset('mesh', times=[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0])


# In[14]:


b.run_compute(irrad_method='none')


# At time=t0=0, we can see that the spot is where defined: 45 degrees south of the north pole and 90 degree longitude (where longitude of 0 is defined as pointing towards the companion star at t0).

# In[23]:


print "t0 = {}".format(b.get_value('t0', context='system'))


# In[16]:


axs, artists = b.plot(time=0, facecolor='teffs', facecmap='YlOrRd', edgecolor=None, y='zs')


# At a later time, the spot is still technically at the same coordinates, but longitude of 0 no longer corresponds to pointing to the companion star.  The coordinate system has rotated along with the asyncronous rotation of the star.

# In[17]:


axs, artists = b.plot(time=0.25, facecolor='teffs', facecmap='YlOrRd', edgecolor=None, y='zs')


# In[18]:


axs, artists = b.plot(time=0.5, facecolor='teffs', facecmap='YlOrRd', edgecolor=None, y='zs')


# In[19]:


axs, artists = b.plot(time=0.75, facecolor='teffs', facecmap='YlOrRd', edgecolor=None, y='zs')


# Since the syncpar was set to 1.5, one full orbit later the star (and the spot) has made an extra half-rotation.

# In[20]:


axs, artists = b.plot(time=1.0, facecolor='teffs', facecmap='YlOrRd', edgecolor=None, y='zs')
