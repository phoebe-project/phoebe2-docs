### [phoebe](phoebe.md).arange (function)


```py

def arange(start, stop, step, unit=None)

```



This is an nparray wrapper around the numpy function.  The
numpy documentation is included below.  Currently most kwargs
should be accepted with the exception of 'dtype'.  The returned
object should act exactly like the numpy array itself, but with
several extra helpful methods and attributes.  Call help on the
resulting object for more information.

If you have astropy installed, units are supported by passing unit=astropy.unit
to the instantiation funcitons or by multiplying an array with a unit object.

===============================================================


arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None)

    Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.

    Values are generated within the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``
    (in other words, the interval including `start` but excluding `stop`).
    For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in
    `range &lt;<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html&gt;`_">http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html&gt;`_</a> function,
    but returns an ndarray rather than a list.

    When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, the results will often not
    be consistent.  It is better to use ``linspace`` for these cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : number, optional
        Start of interval.  The interval includes this value.  The default
        start value is 0.
    stop : number
        End of interval.  The interval does not include this value, except
        in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point
        round-off affects the length of `out`.
    step : number, optional
        Spacing between values.  For any output `out`, this is the distance
        between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``.  The default
        step size is 1.  If `step` is specified as a position argument,
        `start` must also be given.
    dtype : dtype
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    arange : ndarray
        Array of evenly spaced values.

        For floating point arguments, the length of the result is
        ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``.  Because of floating point overflow,
        this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater
        than `stop`.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.arange(3,7,2)
    array([3, 5])
