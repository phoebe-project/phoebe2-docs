### [phoebe](phoebe.md).install_passband (function)


```py

def install_passband(fname, local=True)

```



Install a passband from a local file.  This simply copies the file into the
install path - but beware that clearing the installation will clear the
passband as well

If local=False, you must have permissions to access the installation directory
