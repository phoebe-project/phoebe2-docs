    "The following two arguments, `effwl` and `wlunits`, also come as a pair.

Effective wavelength is a transmission-weighted average wavelength in the units given by `wlunits`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calibrated` parameter instructs PHOEBE whether to take the transmission function as calibrated, i.e. the flux through the passband is absolutely calibrated. If set to `True`, PHOEBE will assume that absolute intensities computed using the passband transmission function do not need further calibration. If `False`, the intensities are considered as scaled rather than absolute, i.e. correct to a scaling constant. Most modern passbands provided in the recent literature are calibrated.\n",

    "The `reference` parameter holds a reference string to the literature from which the transmission function was taken from. It is common that updated transmission functions become available, which is the point of the `version` parameter.
