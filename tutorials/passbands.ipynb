If set to `True`, PHOEBE will assume that absolute intensities computed using the passband transmission function do not need further calibration. If `False`, the intensities are considered as scaled rather than absolute, i.e. correct to a scaling constant. Most modern passbands provided in the recent literature are calibrated.\n",
