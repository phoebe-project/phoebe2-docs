# PHOEBE Logic for Computing Observables
# ============================
# 
# The general logic steps that PHOEBE uses for each observable type are as follows:
# 
# 1. Dynamics - each star or body in the system hierarchy needs to be placed in the correct position in the orbit at any given time.  Some observables (dynamical RVs and ETVs) simply use information from the dynamics and do not use any of the following steps.
# 2. Meshing - each star or body in the system needs to be discretized (if applicable), creating a mesh of triangles that describe the shape of the surface.
# 3. Local Quantities - at any given time, each surface element needs to have its local quantities populated.  These include things like effective temperature and intensity.
# 4. Eclipse Detection - each star needs to detect which of its surface elements are eclipsed, and handle subdivision if necessary to increase the resolution along the eclipse edge.
# 5. Integration - lastly, the local quantities need to be integrated over all visible surface elements to compute a single observable value at the given time
