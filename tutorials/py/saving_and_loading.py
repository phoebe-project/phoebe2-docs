# Saving and Loading
# ============================
# 
# Setup
# -----------------------------

# As always, let's do imports and initialize a logger and a new bundle.  See [Building a System](building_a_system.html) for more details.

# In[1]:


import phoebe
from phoebe import u # units
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

logger = phoebe.logger(clevel='INFO')

b = phoebe.default_binary()


# Saving a Bundle
# -----------------------
# 
# 

# In[2]:


b['incl@orbit'] = 56.789


# To save the Bundle to a file, we can call the save method of the Bundle and pass a filename.

# In[3]:


print b.save('test.phoebe')


# We can now inspect the contents of the created file.
# 
# This file is in the JSON-format and is simply a list of dictionaries - where each dictionary represents the attributes of a single Parameter.
# 
# You could edit this file in a text-editor - but do be careful if changing any of the tags.  For example: if you want to change the component tag of one of your stars, make sure to change ALL instances of the component tag to match (as well as the hierarchy Parameter).

# In[4]:


get_ipython().system(u'head -n 30 test.phoebe')


# Loading a Bundle
# ----------------------

# To open an existing Bundle from the file we just created, call Bundle.open and pass the filename.

# In[5]:


b2 = phoebe.Bundle.open('test.phoebe')


# Just to prove this worked, we can check to make sure we retained the changed value of inclination.

# In[6]:


print b2.get_value('incl@orbit')


# Support for Other Codes
# ------------------------------
# 
# ### Legacy
# 
# Importing from a PHOEBE Legacy file is as simple as passing the filename to from_legacy:

# In[7]:


b = phoebe.Bundle.from_legacy('legacy.phoebe')


# Exporting to a PHOEBE Legacy file is also possible (although note that some parameters don't translate exactly or are not supported in PHOEBE Legacy).

# In[8]:


b.export_legacy('legacy_export.phoebe')


# For the parameters that could not be directly translated, you should see a warning message (if you have warning messages enabled in your logger).
# 
# We can now look at the beginning of the saved file and see that it matches the PHOEBE Legacy file-format.

# In[9]:


get_ipython().system(u'head -n 30 legacy_export.phoebe')
