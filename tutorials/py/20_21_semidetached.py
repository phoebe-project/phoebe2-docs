# 2.0 - 2.1 Migration: Semidetached
# ============================

# In PHOEBE 2.1, [rpole and potential have been replaced with requiv](20_21_requiv).  That means that the constraint used to handle semidetached systems has also changed.

# In[1]:


import phoebe
b = phoebe.default_binary()


# ### requiv_max

# In PHOEBE 2.1, there is a new constrained Parameter that allows access to the critical value of requiv at which overflow would occur (for a detached system - contact systems have requiv_min and requiv_max).

# In[3]:


print b['requiv_max@primary@constraint']


# In order to create a semidetached system, you create a constraint as in PHOEBE 2.0, except instead of choosing 'critical_rpole' or 'critical_pot' constraints, use a new constraint called 'semidetached'.

# In[4]:


b.add_constraint('semidetached', 'primary')


# In[6]:


print b['requiv@primary@constraint']
