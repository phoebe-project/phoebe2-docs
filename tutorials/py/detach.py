# Advanced: Detaching from Run Compute
# ============================
# 
# Setup
# -----------------------------

# As always, let's do imports and initialize a logger and a new Bundle.  See [Building a System](building_a_system.html) for more details.

# In[1]:


get_ipython().magic(u'matplotlib inline')


# In[2]:


import phoebe
from phoebe import u # units
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

logger = phoebe.logger()

b = phoebe.default_binary()


# Now we'll add datasets

# In[3]:


b.add_dataset('lc', times=np.linspace(0,20,501))


# Run Compute
# ----------------
# 
# Here we just pass detach=True to any run_compute call.  We'll immediately be returned to the prompt instead of waiting for the results to complete.

# In[4]:


b.run_compute(detach=True, model='mymodel')


# If we then try to access the model, we see that there is instead a single parameter that is a placeholder - this parameter stores information on how to check the progress of the run_compute job and how to load the resulting model once it's complete

# In[5]:


b['mymodel']


# Re-attaching to a Job
# ------------------------------
# 
# We can check on the job's status

# In[6]:


b['mymodel'].status


# If we want, we can even save the Bundle and load it later to retrieve the results.  In this case where the job is being run in a different Python thread but on the same machine, you cannot, however, exit Python or restart your machine.  
# 
# When detaching and running on a server (coming soon), you will then be able to exit your Python session or even open the Bundle on a different machine.

# In[7]:


b.save('test_detach.bundle')


# In[8]:


b = phoebe.Bundle.open('test_detach.bundle')


# In[9]:


b['mymodel'].status


# And at any point we can choose to "re-attach".  If the job isn't yet complete, we'll be in a wait loop until it is.  Once the job is complete, the new model will be loaded and accessible.

# In[10]:


b['mymodel'].attach()


# In[11]:


b['mymodel']


# In[12]:


axs, artists = b['mymodel'].plot()
