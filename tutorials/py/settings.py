# Advanced: Settings
# ============================
# 
# The Bundle also contains a few Parameters that provide settings for that Bundle.  Note that these are not system-wide and only apply to the current Bundle.  They are however maintained when [saving and loading](./saving_and_loading) a Bundle.
# 
# Setup
# -----------------------------

# As always, let's do imports and initialize a logger and a new Bundle.  See [Building a System](building_a_system.html) for more details.

# In[1]:


import phoebe
from phoebe import u # units

logger = phoebe.logger()

b = phoebe.default_binary()


# Accessing Settings
# ---------------------------

# Settings are found with their own context in the Bundle and can be accessed through the get_setting method

# In[2]:


b.get_setting()


# or via filtering/twig access

# In[3]:


b['setting']


# and can be set as any other Parameter in the Bundle

# Available Settings
# --------------------------
# 
# Now let's look at each of the available settings and what they do

# ### log_history
# 
# log_history is a BooleanParameter (defaults to False) that controls whether undo/redo ability is enabled.

# In[5]:


b['log_history@setting'].description


# This parameter can also be set by calling b.enable_history() or b.disable_history() and can be accessed with b.history_enabled.

# In[6]:


b['log_history@setting']


# In[7]:


b.history_enabled


# In[8]:


b.enable_history()


# In[9]:


b['log_history@setting']


# In[10]:


b.history_enabled


# ### dict_set_all
# 
# dict_set_all is a BooleanParameter (defaults to False) that controls whether attempting to set a value to a ParameterSet via dictionary access will set all the values in that ParameterSet (if True) or raise an error (if False)

# In[11]:


b['dict_set_all@setting']


# In[12]:


b['teff@component']


# In our default binary there are temperatures ('teff') parameters for each of the components ('primary' and 'secondary').  If we were to do:
# 
# b['teff@component'] = 6000
# 
# this would raise an error.  Under-the-hood, this is simply calling:
# 
# b.set_value('teff@component', 6000)
# 
# which of course would also raise an error.
# 
# In order to set both temperatures to 6000, you would either have to loop over the components or call the set_value_all method:

# In[13]:


b.set_value_all('teff@component', 4000)
print b['value@teff@primary@component'], b['value@teff@secondary@component']


# If you want dictionary access to use set_value_all instead of set_value, you can enable this parameter

# In[14]:


b['dict_set_all@setting'] = True
b['teff@component'] = 8000
print b['value@teff@primary@component'], b['value@teff@secondary@component']


# Now let's disable this so it doesn't confuse us while looking at the other options

# In[15]:


b['dict_set_all@setting'] = False


# ### dict_filter
# 
# dict_filter is a Parameter that accepts a dictionary.  This dictionary will then always be sent to the filter call which is done under-the-hood during dictionary access.

# In[16]:


b['incl']


# In our default binary, there are several inclination parameters - one for each component ('primary', 'secondary', 'binary') and one with the constraint context (to keep the inclinations aligned).
# 
# This can be inconvenient... if you want to set the value of the binary's inclination, you must always provide extra information (like '@component').
# 
# Instead, we can always have the dictionary access search in the component context by doing the following

# In[17]:


b['dict_filter@setting'] = {'context': 'component'}


# In[18]:


b['incl']


# Now we no longer see the constraint parameters.
# 
# All parameters are always accessible with method access:

# In[19]:


b.filter(qualifier='incl')


# Now let's reset this option... keeping in mind that we no longer have access to the 'setting' context through twig access, we'll have to use methods to clear the dict_filter

# In[20]:


b.set_value('dict_filter@setting', {})
