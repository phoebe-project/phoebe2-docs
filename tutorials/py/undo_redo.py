# Advanced: Undo/Redo
# ============================
# 
# Setup
# -----------------------------

# As always, let's do imports and initialize a logger and a new bundle.  See [Building a System](building_a_system.html) for more details.

# In[1]:


get_ipython().magic(u'matplotlib inline')


# In[2]:


import phoebe
from phoebe import u # units
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

logger = phoebe.logger(clevel='INFO')

b = phoebe.default_binary()


# Enabling/Disabling Logging History
# ---------------------------------------------

# Undo and redo support is built directly into the bundle.  Every time you make a change to a parameter or call a method, a new Parameter is created with the 'history' context.  These parameters then know how to undo or redo that action.  Of course, this can result in a large list of Parameters that you may not want - see the tutorial on [Settings](settings) for more details on how to change the log size or enable/disable history entirely.
# 
# By default history logging is off, so let's first enable it.

# In[3]:


b.enable_history()


# Undoing
# ---------------

# First let's set a value so we know what we're expecting to undo

# In[4]:


b['ra@system']


# In[5]:


b['ra@system'] = 10
b['ra@system']


# The history context contains a list of parameters, all numbered and ugly.  But there is a convenience method which allows you to get history items by index - including reverse indexing.  This is probably the most common way to get a history item... and you'll most likely want the LATEST item.

# In[6]:


b.get_history(-1)


# In[7]:


print b.get_history(-1)['redo_func'], b.get_history(-1)['redo_kwargs']


# Here you can see that redo_func and redo_kwargs shows exactly the last call we made to the bundle that actually changed something (we did b['ra@system'] = 10).  
# 
# We can also look at what will be called when we undo this item

# In[8]:


print b.get_history(-1)['undo_func'], b.get_history(-1)['undo_kwargs']


# If we want, we can then automatically call that undo method (note that you can also pass the index to undo, but it does assume -1 by default)

# In[9]:


b.undo()


# And we can see that it did exactly what we expected.

# In[10]:


b['ra@system']
