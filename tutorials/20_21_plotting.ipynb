    "In PHOEBE 2.1, the plotting logic has been rewritten from scratch within a separate package called [autofig](https://github.com/kecnry/autofig). By doing so, the plotting is now much more flexible and significantly less buggy while also allowing the plotting logic itself to be tested and used outside of PHOEBE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version [1.0 of autofig](https://github.com/kecnry/autofig/tree/1.0.0) is included and built within PHOEBE 2.1 as `phoebe.dependencies.autofig`, regardless of whether you have a standalone autofig installed on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling `b.plot()`, PHOEBE loops through the filtered ParameterSet and makes one or multiple calls to autofig by extracting the necessary arrays and setting reasonable defaults. To see what these calls are, make sure to have the logger set to a level of 'INFO'. `b.plot()` then returns the autofig object, as well as the matplotlib figure object (if you set `show=True` or `save=filename`).\n",

    "### Linewidth/Markersize\n",
    "\n",
    "Autofig attempts to unify calls across matplotlib, including linewidth and markersize. It does so by including the size as an addition dimension `s`. This means that you can pass a value (float) for the size and it will apply to both the linewidth and markersize. If you want separate sizes, you will need to make multiple calls, one with linestyle disabled and the other with marker disabled.\n",

    "Similar to size, autofig includes color (for markers and lines), facecolor (for mesh plots only) and edgecolor (for mesh plots only) as additional dimensions.  These are called `c`, `fc`, and `ec`, respectively. This means that you can pass a color (as a string, like 'blue') to any of these arguments, an array (with same length as the underlying data), or a twig/qualifier. The other options for colors (map, lim, unit, label) are all prefixed with this single character (e.g., `fcmap='axmhot'`, `eclabel='temperatures'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "PHOEBE 2.1 will attempt to map those onto the autofig names, but it may be less confusing to just stick to the single letter versions. The order of fallback preference for PHOEBE 2.1 is the single character, then the plural version (facecolors), and finally the singular version (facecolor). However, this mapping is NOT done for the extra options (map, lim, etc).\n"

    "\n",
    "If you wanted to manually set your own colors for different datasets, for example, you'd have to filter first and make multiple calls to `b.plot()` in PHOEBE 2.0.  That will still work in PHOEBE 2.1, but you can now also pass any option as a dictionary, and the values will be applied whenever they match.  For example: `b.plot(..., color={'primary': 'blue', 'secondary': 'red', 'lc01', 'black'})`.\n",

    "In PHOEBE 2.1, with autofig, the points retain there time-order information, are wrapped according to phase, and the line is broken when wrapping in phase (see [this autofig example](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kecnry/autofig/blob/1.0.0/gallery/looping_indep.ipynb) for a visual explanation).

    "\n",
    "But be careful: successive calls to `b.plot()` will keep appending to the same autofig figure **until** you call `show()` and/or `save()`. At that point, the next call to `b.plot()` will start over on a blank figure.  So, if you want to make any changes, you'll either need to rerun the same lines of code, or keep track of the autofig object itself and make changes there."

Autofig now handles all of this logic and should fix the vast majority of these annoying bugs."
