# Datasets and Observables

The following tutorials aim to both explain the general logic that PHOEBE uses to compute observables as well as explaining the parameters, fields, and options for each observable type.

These aim to be quite thorough and may not be best for light-reading. They expect a comfortable understanding of using PHOEBE and python

* [How does PHOEBE compute observables](tutorials/phoebe_logic.ipynb)
* [Orbits (orb)](tutorials/ORB.ipynb)
* [Meshes (mesh)](tutorials/MESH.ipynb)
* [Light Curves (lc)](tutorials/LC.ipynb)
* [Radial Velocities (rv)](tutorials/RV.ipynb)
* [Line Profiles (lp)](tutorials/LP.ipynb)
