## Updating Documentation

### Index Markdown Pages

All markdown pages (except in the [API](./api) directory) can be edited manually and pushed.  Make sure the page is rendered correctly both here on GitHub and on the website.

### Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks can be updated locally, but make sure you have the matching version of PHOEBE installed on your machine and that you run the notebook through entirely before saving and pushing your changes.  Python scripts are automatically generated by Travis, do **NOT** manually edit the files in tutorials/py or examples/py.

### API Docs

Updates to the API docs for archived versions of PHOEBE should be done directly to the markdown files.  For active versions of PHOEBE, the updates should be made to the docstring in the source-code itself in the [phoebe2 repository](http://github.com/phoebe-project/phoebe2) and either copied to the markdown or recompiled.

To recompile the markdown versions of the API docs from the source code, make sure the installed version of PHOEBE matches the branch of the documentation and then call the [make_apidocs.py](./make_apidocs.py) script.  Commit and push all necessary changes.
